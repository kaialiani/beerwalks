        <h1>About BeerWalks</h1>
        <h2>Our passion is craft beer, stories and walks!</h2>
        <h3>BeerWalks is an idea that emerged during the first national shutdown in March 2020 due to Covid-19.

            Christoffer Hundahl Hansen decided to explore Copenhagen by taking walks under the city lights - while enjoying cold craft beers from Mikkeller and the Bornholm breweries.
            
            He invited friends on these very special evening winter walks, while telling stories about the area, the breweries and the beers, and the feedback was: "This is cool, relaxed and more fun than the Covid-19 sofa!".
            
            Therefore, Christoffer and his team are proud to present BeerWalks in collaboration with the breweries Mikkeller, Small Batch Bornholm, Beer Here, Penyllan and Svaneke Bryghus.
            
            <b>BeerWalks is a 100% outdoor activity.</b> These are guided walks of up to 4.5 km, and they last approx. 2.5 hours.
            
            At all BeerWalks you will hear stories about the area we explore, the breweries and the beer we taste on the trip.
            
            BeerWalks is togetherness with distance, it's beer, stories and walks, it's 100% outdoors.

The Slowbeer philosophy is the secret behind the good beer taste, because the beer is not accelerated. The brewmaster closely follows the beer in the desire for taste balance, and nothing leaves the brewery without his acceptance.</h3>

The vision was, as part of Hallegaard's food concept, to also brew its own high quality beer. In 2016, Johnny and Anders took over the entire company and moved to their own premises at the harbor in Rønne, where beer is brewed in balance. </h3>
